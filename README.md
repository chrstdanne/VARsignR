DESCRIPTION
This toolbox provides a set of functions for identifying structural shocks in Vector Autoregressions (VARs) using sign restrictions in R. Currently, it implements Uhlig's rejection method, Uhlig's penalty function approach, and Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner, and Zha's QR-based rejection algorithm. For more information on the three methods see: 

Rubio-Ramirez et al. (2010), "Structural Vector Autoregressions: Theory of Identification and Algorithms for Inference", Review of Economic Studies, 77, 665-696.

Uhlig(2005), "What are the effects of monetary policy on output? Results from an agnostic identification procedure", Journal of Monetary Economics, 52, 381-419.

Full package development is currently on its way. More routines and features will be added to the repository once they are finished and tested. 

IMPORTANT NOTE
